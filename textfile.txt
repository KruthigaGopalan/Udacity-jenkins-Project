Master Branch 
This branch contains the files that create the network and servers using cloud formations.  


Pipeline Branch
The branch contains the files for the Jenkins build and the field that gets copied into the S3 bucket.

I have a nohup error that I could not able to fix this and hence I could not continue to integrate the s3 and lint to the pipeline.
